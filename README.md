Online teaching environment for computer vision/OpenCV in python and C++

This is a simple project I originally created for training new students on the Ratchet Rockers robotics team 1706. This uses Django and is my first project created with it, so excuse the noobishness. Feel free to extend and use as interested. Contributions are welcome!
